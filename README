This is an example of using the following django applications:

* django-openid-auth
* python-openid (used internally by django-openid-auth)
* django-profiles for User profile management.

Thhe django-openid-auth is used along with openid-selector (http://code.google.com/p/openid-selector/) to display a nice UI for the user to select a OpenID Provider
